title: Why Taiko
---

- Ethereum has a scaling problem
- We believe in Ethereum's properties
- Rollups should extend these properties
- Thus we are building a based rollup that maintains those properties
- In a sense Taiko doesn't exist, it's a proxy between the user and Ethereum
- Based contestable rollup
- Based booster rollup
