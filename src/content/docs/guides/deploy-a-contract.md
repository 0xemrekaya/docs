This guide will help you deploy a smart contract on Taiko.

## Prerequisites

- A wallet with some testnet ETH on Taiko (can receive this from [the bridge](/guides/bridge-tokens)).
- The private key to the account with testnet ETH on Taiko.

## Deploy a contract using Foundry

### 1. Install Foundry

Open a terminal and run the following commands to install Foundry:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### 2. Create a project with Foundry

```bash
forge init hello_foundry && cd hello_foundry
```

### 3. Deploy your contract

Deploy the contract located at `src/Counter.sol`. Replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` below with your private key which has some testnet ETH on Taiko.

```bash
forge create src/Counter.sol:Counter \
  --rpc-url https://rpc.katla.taiko.xyz \
  --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

## Deploy a contract using Hardhat

### 1. Installation NPM, Hardhat and dotenv
To install it, you need to create an npm project by going to an empty folder, running ``npm init``, and following its instructions. You can use another package manager, like yarn, but we recommend you use npm 7 or later, as it makes installing Hardhat plugins simpler.

Once your project is ready, you should run
```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

Also you should install dotenv to manage private key for deployment
```bash
npm install dotenv
```

### 2. Hardhat project setup
We will explore the basics of creating a Hardhat project with a sample contract, tests of that contract, and a script to deploy it.
To create the sample project, run 
```bash
npx hardhat init
```
in your project folder:
````
$ npx hardhat init

### 2. Katla network configuration
To set up your config, you have to export an object from ``hardhat.config.js``.
For Taiko Katla network configuration:
```javascript
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
require('dotenv').config();

/** @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig */
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.20",
  defaultNetwork: "Katla",
  networks: {
    hardhat: {
    },
    Katla: {
      url: "https://rpc.katla.taiko.xyz",
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
    }
  },
};

```
‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è Do not forget create a ``.env`` file and add the your private key in it. ``PRIVATE_KEY=abc..123``

### 3. Compile
To compile your contract, simply run:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### 4. Deploy
To deploy your contract, run this:
```bash
npx hardhat run --network Katla scripts/deploy.js
```

## Deploy a contract using Remix

### 1. Open Remix IDE

https://remix.ethereum.org

### 2. Create a new `.sol` file

![new file](~/assets/content/docs/guides/newfile.png)

- Give it any name, for example `Counter.sol`.
- Fill with this example code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.7.0;

import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v3.4.0-solc-0.7/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract Token is ERC20 {

    constructor () ERC20("Example Token Katla", "ETK") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * (10 ** uint256(decimals())));
    }
}
```

### 3. Compile

- Change the Compiler version to `0.7.0+commit.9e61f92b`

![new file](~/assets/content/docs/guides/compiler.png)

- Then compile it.

### 4. Deploy

- Change the Environment to `Injected Provider`

![new file](~/assets/content/docs/guides/provider.png)

![new file](~/assets/content/docs/guides/transact.png)

- Then click `transact`

- Finally, verify the smart contract using [Blockscout](/guides/verify-a-contract/#verify-a-contract-with-hardhat-or-other-alternatives)
